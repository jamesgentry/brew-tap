I searched, but I couldn't find a Wordpress starter theme that was based on Bootstrap 3 that I liked.  BREW is just pulling together excellent projects such as bootstrap, wordpress, bones, etc into a simple starter theme.  This is very lightweight with only some very mild CSS changes to make everything look nice out of the box.  My goal is to provide a solid foundation for anyone wanting to develop a wordpress theme with bootstrap.

Updates since v.6:
* Updated to Bootstrap 3.1

* Bunch of other stuff I can't remember


To use:
1. download zip and upload as wordpress theme.
2. set your variables at /less/custom-variables.less
3. add customize and add new LESS files in /less/brew


To do before v1.0:
